  "readme": "Highcharts is a JavaScript charting library based on SVG, with fallbacks to VML and canvas for old browsers. This package also contains Highstock, the financial charting package, and Highmaps for geo maps.\n\n_For NPM users, please note that this module replaces the previous [Highcharts Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-server) module._\n\n* Official website: [www.highcharts.com](http://www.highcharts.com)\n* Download page: [www.highcharts.com/download](http://www.highcharts.com/download)\n* Licensing: [www.highcharts.com/license](http://www.highcharts.com/license)\n* Support: [www.highcharts.com/support](http://www.highcharts.com/support)\n* Issues: [Working repo](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues)\n\n## Download and install Highcharts\nPlease note that there are several ways to use Highcharts. For general installation instructions, see [the docs](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation).\n### Use our CDN\nInstead of downloading, you can use our CDN to access files directly. See [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com) for details.\n```\n<script src=\"https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.src.js\"></script>\n```\n### Install from npm\nSee [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) on how to get started with npm.\n```\nnpm install --save highcharts\n```\n\n### Install from Bower\nSee [Bower documentation](https://bower.io/) on how to get started with Bower.\n```\nbower install highcharts\n```\n\n## Load Highcharts as a CommonJS module\nHighcharts is using an UMD module pattern, as a result it has support for CommonJS.\n*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*\n```js\n// Load Highcharts\nvar Highcharts = require('highcharts');\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// var Highcharts = require('highcharts/highstock');\n\n// Load the exporting module, and initialize it.\nrequire('highcharts/modules/exporting')(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n\n## Load Highcharts as an ES6 module\nSince Highcharts supports CommonJS, it can be loaded as an ES6 module with the use of transpilers. Two common transpilers are [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). These have different interpretations of a CommonJS module, which affects your syntax.\n*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*\n### Babel\n```js\nimport Highcharts from 'highcharts';\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';\n\n// Load the exporting module.\nimport Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';\n// Initialize exporting module.\nExporting(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n### TypeScript\n```js\nimport * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';\n\n// Load the exporting module.\nimport * as Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';\n// Initialize exporting module.\nExporting(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n\n## Styled mode vs classic \n* The files for _classic_ mode are available on root. This is the regular mode\nwhere presentational attributes and styling is set in the options structure.\n* The JavaScript files for _styled mode_ are available under the `/js/` folder.\nIn these files, most presentational code including options are removed, so\nwithout styling it will draw an ugly black-and-white chart if anything.\n* The default CSS file for _styled mode_ is available as `/css/highcharts.css`.\nThis CSS is in turn based on a SCSS file, `/css/highcharts.scss`.\n\n",
