Wow! There is a lot that I love about this! There are some things that can be improved a bit too. That lamp really steals the show and in some ways it is all I can look at. It goes great with the quote, but it's position in the design, 3/4ths of the way through, redirects the flow in a distracting way. Could everything be rearranged around it as a central focus? The reorg of the pie charts is really good, but the spacing between the columns doesn't do the grouping with the camera above, which I think was intended. The same goes for the icons for some nudity/sexualized/attractive; I only see those icons and don't notice the bar charts; and boy do they get my attention, which is maybe not what we want here. Nice use of isotypes and very cool use of fonts!!
