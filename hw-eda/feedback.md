# This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Hypotheses
Did you clearly write down your hypotheses or questions at each stage, and investigate them? Did you react to and adjust your hypotheses or questions as the evidence for or against them unfolded?
Great job responding to your initial hypotheses and realizing that your data needs were not what you thought they might be. You did a great job hypothesizing what might be the causes of things without claiming them definitively (e.g., maybe the budget was for the year after doing surveys about bike rack needs; this is a hypothesis that you could follow up on with further research).

Great job also noticing missing data and thinking about what might cause them. I think you are right about missing bike racks under the purview of another entity; GGPark and Ocean Beach I think are both run by the Gate National Recreation Area, which are under the National Park Service, and so have different reporting (I know this because they are the ones who are trying to remove dog access from beaches out there).

# This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Visualization
Did you explore the hypotheses by exercising a variety of graphs, filters and other interactions, and views in Tableau? Did you exercise good judgement in creating your final dashboard (s)? Did you follow good visualization practices as learned in class?

I love the first visualization; I think it is a skinny gantt chart. It is quite informative. I've attached an alternative, but I don't think mine is great.

(ha ha the powerful segway lobby)

In the first dashboard, it is great that you used linking from the year to the map to filter it. I would suggest actually using the bar chart on the left instead, or else removing this chart, or else linking all three together (the Leda example shows how), since this one not changing makes its appearance confusing. 

Another small tip: since your map colors are lovely pastels, you might change the line/bar chart colors to be a hue that fits more within this theme.

Another tip: smaller dots will make the map more readable, see screenshot below.

# This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Presentation
What is the quality of your writeup in terms of the insights and accuracies of what you describe? Did you include sufficient screenshots? Did you describe your data and how you pre-processed it?
Really excellent work making the dashboards come together and linking them with filtering. 

Thanks for the great writeup!
