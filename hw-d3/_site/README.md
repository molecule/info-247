# INFO 247 D3 Assignment

You will build the code over 5 steps:

1. Find a set of data and format it like the example "data.csv". Try not to have too many points (10-20 would be good).
2. Create a static scatter plot for a single year.
3. Color the points on the scatter plot.
4. Animate the points to cycle through years.
5. Add any other styling you wish. Please be creative!

Example images are included.
